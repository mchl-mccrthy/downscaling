# A MATLAB toolbox for statistical downscaling of climate reanalysis data

This toolbox implements algorithms with which climate reanalysis data can be statistically downscaled from low to high spatial resolution for climate impact models. The climate variables considered include air temperature, precipitation, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and relative humidity. Air temperature, dewpoint temperature and precipitation are downscaled following Machguth et al (2009), as described by McCarthy et al (2022). Atmospheric pressure and incoming longwave radiation are downscaled following Cosgrove et al (2003), wind speed is downscaled following Liston and Elder (2006), incoming shortwave radiation is downscaled simply using a thin-plate spline (i.e., there is no topographic correction as this is often done internally in climate impact models), and relative humidity is computed from downscaled air and dewpoint temperature, similar to Rouf et al (2020). The algorithms can be used to downscale to a grid or to point locations.

## Using the toolbox
The scripts example_grid.m and example_points.m show how to use the toolbox to downscale to a grid or to points, respectively.

## Input data
Inputs from the climate reanalysis include latitude, longitude, elevation, time, air temperature, precipitation, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, atmospheric pressure, u and v components of wind, and dewpoint temperature. Latitude, longitude and elevation data of the grid or points to which the reanalysis will be downscaled must also be provided. Example input data are provided in the folder /Inputs. 

## Output data
Outputs from the climate reanalysis include air temperature, precipitation, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and relative humidity. Running the example scripts will produce example output data in a folder /Outputs.
